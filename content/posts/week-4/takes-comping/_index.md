If you record on top of an media item, Reaper automatically creates takes. This allows you to choose which performance you like better, or compile parts from each performance into a new and better take.

Click on the take to choose which take you hear during playback. Or, use keyboard shortcut _T_ to select next take or _shift + t_ for the previous take.

To comp takes, create splits between phrases. You can then select parts of each performance. If we like the combination of takes we selected, we can select the takes and "crop to active take" (right click -> take -> crop to active take OR shift + command + t).

If we want to be able to compare different comps, we can save the comps instead of cropping to active take (right click -> comp -> save as new comp). Make sure to select all of the items you want in your comp first. Saving a comp allows us to choose a comped take without making our choices permanent. You can switch between comps using _Comp takes: Activate next comp_. You can also rename the active comp, remove it, crop list to active comp, or _move active comp to top lane._ This last option moves your selected comp to the top lane so you can see it more easily. See the other actions for comping takes for other useful actions.

When you decide on the take you want you should lock your takes so that you don't accidentally chose the wrong take. Do this with _Item properties: Lock to active take (mouse click will not change active take)_.

We can now use these techniques to comp together different takes from our percussion recording.

If we're happy with the take or comp we can collapse the take lanes by selecting _Options: Show all takes in lanes (when room)_ and turning it off.
