## Punch in / punch out

Using takes and comping is one way of getting a good performance while recording. But, sometimes you just want to re-record a specific section of a track that you messed up. The easiest way to punch in is to record only the part you want to replace. Reaper will create a take for the part you recorded, allowing you to easily replace it with takes.

## Time selection auto punch

We can re-record specific sections with the _time selection auto punch_ recording mode. It provides a more flexible way to re-record than the simple method listed above without having to manually stop the recording when you want to punch out.

Make a time selection on the part that you want to record over. Go to the record button on the bottom of your toolbar and right click -> Record Mode: time selection auto punch.

If you would like to loop a specific section you can unlink looping and time selection by selecting _Options: Toggle loop points linked to time selection_.

In the metronome settings select _pre-roll before recording_. This allows you to start playing before the section that you want to record over. Reaper will record when you click the record button, but you will only see the material that is in the time selection. The pre-roll helps the performer be ready to play when the selected portion appears. It also makes it easier to edit between the new recording and what's before and after it.

## Selected item auto-punch

If there are multiple places you would like to re-record you can set the record mode to selected item auto-punch. Create splits in items that you want to re-record and select them. Now Reaper will only punch in for the items you have selected. This is a pretty helpful way to get a good performance.

This method is similar to pre-roll. Choose whatever method works best for your and your project.
