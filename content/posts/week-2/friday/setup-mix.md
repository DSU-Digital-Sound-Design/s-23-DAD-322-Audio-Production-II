title: "Importing and Organizing"

Find a project from [The 'Mixing Secrets' Free Multitrack Download Library](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/) to practice with. Once it's downloaded create a new Reaper project. Set the project settings like below:

Now, open the notes that come with the tracks to see what the BPM should be set to. Then, drag in your tracks. Make sure they're in number order and color them by track type.

Organize like tracks into folders. Drums will all go into a drums folder. Guitars into a guitars folder, etc. Use the track manager to organize larger projects.

## Label song sections with markers

Insert markers to delineate song sections using the _M_ shortcut. View all of your markers easily in the _Region/Marker Manager_.

## Trimming silence

We're now going to clean up up each track by editing out the silences and sections where other instruments bleed into the mic. We have to listen to each track one by one to do this. It will also help us learn the mix. We should also listen for any imperfection in the recording to try to fix them before we start the mixing.

This process is often called "strip silence" in various DAWs.

In Reaper this can be done with "Dynamic Split". First, make the track large with "shift + !".Then click "D" to open up the dynamic split dialogue. Select "when gate opens" and "when gate closes". Then change the gate threshold until you reach your desired outcome. It's better to take out less because it can sound really artificial to cut in and out. Try this first on a vocal track.

> Also try "Item: Auto trim/split items (remove silence)..."

Use the below settings:

## How to use a reference mix

- Setup a folder with all your tracks
- Add your reference mix outside of the folder. Make sure this track isn't routed through your master if you have any master fx.
- Match the loudness with LUFS Meter. Use your ears and the meter
- Now you can A/B between your reference mix and your mix
- In Reaper use option + command to exclusive solo
- add more references as takes
