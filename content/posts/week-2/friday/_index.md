## Mixing tips

- Listen on different speakers and in different rooms, our ears can get used to speakers very quickly.
- Take lots of breaks! Your ears get tired quickly.
  - This is especially true for your higher frequency perception
- Listen at low volumes most of the time
- Let your peers listen and give you feedback

- At loud volumes you'll hear more the the frequency extremes of your mix. Remember that the most important parts of the mix are the midrange.
- But you eventually need to test your music out at other volumes, very quiet and very loud.

# Mix Referencing

{{% note %}}

- How do you know what a mix should sound like? You have to listen to other people's mixes and compare them to yours. Reference mixing is picking a mix that is similar to yours, not just something you like. It can even be music you don't like but is mixed well.
- This will help us make objective decisions, you have something to compare to.
