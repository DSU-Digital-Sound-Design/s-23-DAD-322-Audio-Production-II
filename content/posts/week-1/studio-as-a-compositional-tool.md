title: "The Studio As a Compositional Tool"
---

- What effect did recording have on our ability to perceive and listen to music?
- How did recording change the way music was composed?
- Why did Eno use jazz music as an example for this section?
- What do you think of the idea that recorded took music otu a time and place? What effects did the internet have on doing this when you were growing up?
- Tape was a major change in what had come before. What was this change?
- How is tape actually manipulated?
- Why was the invention of three track recording important?
- What's the additive approach to recording?
- Have you always used Eno's method of in-studio composition, where there's no conception of a finished piece before the recording or production is started?
- When Eno talks about the "transmission loss" of a classical composer, what does he mean? How is a composer now a days more like a painter?
- "So I think there is a difference in kind between the kind of composition I do and the kind a classical composer does. This is evidenced by the fact that I can neither read nor write music, and I can’t play any instruments really well, either. You can’t imagine a situation prior to this where anyone like me could have been a composer. It couldn’t have happened. How could I do it without tape and without technology?"
- Have these technological changes in music making better music? How so?
