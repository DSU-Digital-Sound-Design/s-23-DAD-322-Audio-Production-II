title: "Manual Drum Editing"
---

We can also do manual drum editing to be more careful about what gets edited. If the performance was already pretty good, this can be a good option.

We'll try this first with our drums from last class, then we'll try with a different song.

Before beginning to edit, check that your drums are as in phase as possible with each other. Align them if they are not. This is important for parts of the drums that were multimiced. This could be the snare or kickdrum.

Make sure _overlap and crossfade items when splitting_ is enabled.

Group all of your drums. Now, go through and add splits before hits that are out of time. Then click _option_ and slip edit the offending hit into place.

This method might take much longer than the auto transient method we learned on Wednesday, but you'll have much more control and possibly get a better result.

The best method will depend upon the project.
