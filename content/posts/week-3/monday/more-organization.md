## Grouping tracks

Look for instruments in your project that were recorded with more than one microphone. Lets group these tracks together so that we can adjust their volume at the same time. Select the tracks you want to group. Press "shift + g" to bring up the group menu. Click "all" to have all of the track parameters linked together. If you need to quickly adjust one parameter of a group you can click "shift" then select that parameter.

## Multing

Multing is splitting a track into multiple tracks in order to treat the instrument differently. This can be useful for an instrument that plays in different ways on different parts of the song. This is really common with vocals because of the variety of sounds that a voice can make.

Leslie Brathwaite talks about this in relation to mixing Pharell Williams’ “Happy”:

> “The reason to keep the tracks split out is that I’ll treat each vocal track slightly differently based on its characteristics . . . Pharell will have sung the hooks a bit more aggressively, because he is singing with the backing vocals behind him. This means that the compression in the verse lead will be a bit different from that on the hook lead."
