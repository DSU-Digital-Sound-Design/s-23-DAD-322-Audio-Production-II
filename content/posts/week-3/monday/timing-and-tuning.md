Download the [Living in the City](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/#HurrayForTheRiffRaff) recordings to use for practicing tempo mapping.

If your track was recorded to a click editing will be much easier. If it wasn't you'll need to adjust the tempo of your DAW to match the recording so that you can do timing editing later.

## Tempo Mapping

To do this we'll need the [SWS / S&M Extension](https://www.sws-extension.org/) package installed.

Set the timebases as shown below:

Set the grid divisions to quarter notes (1/4) in the _Snap/Grid_ settings.

Next, delete the empty time so that your timeline starts with the start of the stick count off.

Make a tempo map to align things to your drums without having it be a strict grid. Click view and tempo map to see the tempo. Use an instrument that plays on the 1 of a measure to make a tempo map. Now you can use the tempo map to align your tracks to the drums.

To create the sample map, we'll use a few SWS extension actions. Add a maker at the start of each bar while listening to the track. Then use the SWS extension "Convert project markers to tempo markers." This will remove your markers and add tempo changes. Do this before you add organizational markers. Before you move on, remove the stretch markers. We won't be using them this time.

Check your tempo map to make sure the tempo markers are in the correct locations.
