## Class Lab

Let's get some hands on experimenting with balance and compression in your own mixes

- Install a few types of compressors and experiment with them
- [MCompressor](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MCompressor), [RoughRider 3](https://www.audiodamage.com/pages/free-downloads), [TDR Kotelnikov](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-kotelnikov/)

Instructions:

Open the Hurray For the Riff Raff drum editing project we did a few weeks ago. Add ReaComp to the kick drum track. Turn on auto-makeup gain. Set the ratio to 4:1. For every 1 dB of signal we'll decrease the gain by 4 dB. 

The attack setting determine how long the compressor takes to respond to a change in volume. The release setting determines how long the compressor takes to recover from a change in volume.

Now do the same to the other kicks and snares, then the hi-hats.

As you add plugins, check the "Project Media Bay/FX" view to bypass all compressors at once. Use this to hear the cumulative difference.

Now compress your room microphones, but this time with the 1175 Compressor that comes with Reaper. Set the ratio to 4. Adjust the threshold to your liking. with this plugin you have to adjust teh gain manually. Try to get it back to the input level.

Finally, group all of the drums in a folder and apply a 1175 compressor to the folder. Notice how extreme parameter settings can have a drastic effect on the timbre of the track.

Try this whole process again with at least one other compressor. AB the results and decide which one you prefer.

## Voice Compression

Now add the vocal sample to the project and try to compress it.
