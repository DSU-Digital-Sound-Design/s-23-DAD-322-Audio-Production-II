title: "Building the Raw Balance"

> See [Chapter 8: Balance](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/ch8/) for Mike Senior's demo on creating balance.

## Start with the most important section

Before setting the most important section, we should add regions around the sections so that we can easily see where sections start and end.

What is the most important section of this song?

> “I’ll start with the louder or bigger section [with] the most instruments . . . the chorus typically, or maybe the bridge” says Neal Avron, for instance. “And then the rest of it is kind of ‘unbuilding’ for the verses and the intros.”

After we pick the most important section we'll start the mix there. From that point we can mix the other sections in relation to that one, making sure to leave the most important section the loudest and most upfront.

We might design the dynamic structure of a mix like this:

The chorus's are the most important parts so we mix all of those first.

## Start with the Most Important Instrument

Now that we've chosen the structure our mix will take, we have to find the most important instrument. What is that for this song? We'll bring up this fader first, then decide what else is important and go in that order. If we go in the correct order, we can avoid over-processing when we try to squeeze instruments into a space.

Let's each of us in class write down a list of what we think the most important instruments are in order. We'll discuss why and try to stick to our plan.

## Setting the levels

We'll set the levels of our instruments with our faders, starting with the most important.

### Drums

Usually we start with the drums for music like this. In drum recordings, having good sounding overheads is a nice place to start. These multitracks have a strangely recorded "SnareCymbals" track. We'll start with that.

If we toggle the mono switch to check for mono compatibility you can hear that the cymbals are getting lost in mono. Zoom in on the waveform to check for phase issues. Mike Senior uses a channel delay trick, but that only seems to make our mix worse, so we won't use it.

Add a high pass filter at 20 hZ to cut out subsonic rumble. Raise the fader until you're reaching about -18 dB on the master.

> I docked my mixer on the left side of my screen so I can see it more clearly.

This track doesn't have a dedicated snare track, so we'll treat the snaps at the snare and mix those next. High pass filter the track at 20 hZ. Set the level relative to the snare cymbals track.

Now we'll move onto the kick. We can try to hpf this, but it might not be necessary. Listen carefully if you're cutting out punch with the filter. Check to see if anything is actually happening with Span on your master track.

> Mike Senior is checking polarity often in the video. This is because he's mixing multimiced drums. Our drums were are not multimiced, so we don't need to worry about that.

Now, set the level of the kick to the snare and snarecymbals. Be sure to listen with both sets of speakers. Finally introduce the shakers to round out the drums.

Go to an earlier section of the song and bring in the other drum elements.

## Bass

- high pass at 20 hZ

## Other instruments

Continue the above

## Finishing up

After we're done we'll use the script _Script: X-Raym_Offset selected items volume by their track fader value.lua_ to copy the values of the faders to our media item volumes. We do this so that we can use the faders later for automation or further mixing.

Be sure to switch speakers often to get a good idea of how the balance will sound on different systems and that you're not deceiving yourself. Take lots of breaks and vary your listening levels.

I'm aiming to have everything sounding balanced, while having the master track not go above -6 dB.
