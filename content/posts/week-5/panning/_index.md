title: "Panning"

How is it different for mono or stereo tracks?

- Panning modes are set in the advanced project settings
- Pan modes in Reaper:
  - stereo balance / mono pan - the default setting, works like normal panning for mono tracks and for stereo the knob behaves as a stereo balance knob, changing the volume of each side. This is not the same as shifting the stereo image.
  - Stereo pan - the first knob will now shift the stereo image of a stereo track. Now neither channel will totally disappear. We also have a width knob. If the knob is at 0, the sound will be in mono. The closer we get to 100, the wider the stereo image. Negative values reverse the channels.
  - Dual pan - gives you a fader for each channel and treats each channel as a mono channel. Notice how this makes everything a little louder.
  - We can also change modes per track instead of per project.
