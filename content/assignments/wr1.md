# Edison’s list

## Due: Wednesday, January 11, 1:00 pm

## Submit to: D2L

In an article for the North American Review , Thomas Edison (1878)
imagined 10 possible use cases for his new invention of the phonograph :[^1]

1. Letter writing and dictation without the aid of a stenographer.
2. Phonographic books for the blind.
3. The teaching of elocution.
4. Reproduction of music.
5. The “family record” – a registry of sayings, reminiscences, etc.,
   by members of a family in their own voices, and the last words
   of dying persons.
6. Music-boxes and toys.
7. Clocks that should announce in articulate voice the time for
   going home, going to meals, etc.
8. The preservation of languages by exact reproduction of the manner of pronouncing.
9. Educational purposes such as preserving the explanations
   made by a teacher, so that the pupil can refer to them at any moment, and spelling or other lessons placed upon the phonograph
   for convenience in committing to memory.
10. Connection with the telephone, so as to make that instrument
    an auxiliary in the transmission of permanent and invaluable
    records, instead of being the recipient of momentary and fleeting
    communications.

# Instructions

Prepare a written reply for an in-class discussion:

- Sort Edison’s list according to actual usage today (from frequent
  to rare), according to your best personal estimate.
- Assign a percentage to each item that in your opinion reflects its
  contemporary significance (should add up to 100%).
- For the purpose of the discussion, let’s extend ‘the phonograph’
  to any sound recording technology in general use today. You
  can be liberal in your interpretation of Edison’s list in terms of
  contemporary technology.
- Argue in favor of your list. You can make use of statistics and
  other published information to make your case, but I’m primarily interested in your personal view on recording technology’s
  cultural significance in different areas. Try to consider cultural
  and social contexts other than your own.
- Why are the items at the bottom of your list there? Will some
  of them become more significant in the future? Speculate about
  underlying technological, social, and cultural developments!
- Offer a personal critical perspective on how technology has developed (and will continue to develop) since Edison’s invention.
  Consider the sociocultural changes that accompany these developments, to which degree you are in favor of them, but also in
  which respects you are not.
