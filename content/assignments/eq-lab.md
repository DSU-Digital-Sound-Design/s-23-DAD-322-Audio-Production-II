## Jesper Buhl Trio - What is this thing called love

[Jesper Buhl Trio](https://mtkdata.cambridgemusictechnology.co.uk/MTK002/MR0804_JesperBuhlTrio.zip)

- Create a balance mix.
- Minimize spill on each microphone using ReaGate
- Snare: Optimize the snare’s timbre to taste by means of peaking filters. Also try to remove leakage from other instruments without affecting that timbre, but do not sacrifice too much.
- Bass: Remove leakage from other instruments with a high-cut or hf-shelving filter. Use peaking and notch filters to iron out unpleasant resonances in the bass and give the bass more definition.

## Bobby Nobody - Stitch up

[Bobby Nobody](https://mtkdata.cambridgemusictechnology.co.uk/MTK003/MR0911_BobbyNobody.zip)

- create a balance mix
- Minimize spill on each microphone using ReaGate
- Bass Cab: Attenuate unpleasant resonances and adjust the overall timbre to taste, such that it would mix in well with the rest of the band. Use primarily peaking and notch filters.

## Audio processing pack

- femaleVoice02.aif: Start by identifying the low-frequency background rumble in this recording (which will require a decent pair of headphones or loudspeakers). Remove the rumble with a low-cut filter, but without noticeably affecting the vocal timbre.
  - Or remove it using the ReaFIR FFT filter.
- kick01.aif: Remove leakage from other instruments and improve the kick drum’s definition without introducing unpleasant resonances. Use high-cut or hf-shelving as well as peaking and notch filters.

## Guitar Hum

[Guitar Hum](https://audio.cambridge-mt.com/MSFTSS/Ch11/MS1116_GuitarHum01_Raw.wav)

Remove the ac hum on the guitar, which is best addressed by a series of very sharp notch filters tuned to the harmonics of the recording location’s power line frequency (60 Hz in the us, 50 Hz in Europe – a fantastic way to determine where a recording might originally have been conducted).
