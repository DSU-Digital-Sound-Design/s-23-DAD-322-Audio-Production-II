<!-- TODO: Also, Part 3, Understanding the Mix: Developing Listening and Sound-Evaluation Skills; Part Four. Crafting the Mix: Shaping Music and Sound, and Controlling the Recording Process -->
<!--
This class will build on the listening and analysis they learned in MUS 109 while adding the practical part of learning to mix.

Maybe have them read that Moyan article instead? -->

> Read: [Building Raw Balance](x-devonthink-item://4728FAE2-440C-449E-B62F-2D8289F9C122) and answer questions

## Wednesday

- [Building raw balance](../posts/week-4/balance/)
- [Mixing strategies](x-devonthink-item://D533C16D-A0AF-4319-ABF5-5FCBA0ECA254?page=398)
- Takes and comping
  - create splits between phrases
  - choose which phrase you like better between the takes
  - crop to active take
  - or make a comp and name it to save the other takes
  - then we have some comp options
  - Then check out comp takes
- Try again with drum recording

## Friday

- [Editing 1 - Drum Loop](x-devonthink-item://0F3BAC04-9EA1-441D-BBDB-29B59B315FAE) Due by midnight
- More mixing of Broken Man
  - Check balance again, lets try to keep the tracks from peaking
  - then lets start mixing with the faders, setting them all to -inf dB then bringing them up in order of their importance.
  - adjusting the faders will actually not keep us from doing volume automation later on. This is an issue with Ableton Live, but not Reaper.
  - add [panning](../posts/week-4/panning)
  - let's not forget to listen to our panning changes in mono with the Behritone! do we loose any sounds? If we do let's narrow their image, especially if those are important elements.
  - This mix has no instruments that are multi-miked, this provides its own set of issues which we'll cover in other mixes.
